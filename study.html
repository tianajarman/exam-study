  I have a MISY 350 exam today, October 5, 2017, at 12:30PM. It is on HTML, CSS, Git, and Responsive Design. I'm unsure what the structure will be, but I'm sure it will be relatively difficult in some aspects
  and very easy in others. I hope for an A, because most of the material is easily graspable given a little time. I don't think time will be an issue, either, since it is a 75 minute class and my professor will
  surely give us the entire time to work through the exam if we need it.
